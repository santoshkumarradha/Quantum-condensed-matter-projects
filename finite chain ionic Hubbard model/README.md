solves the above equation for a finite 1D chain using Exact diognlization 

This solver uses a seperate module to compute the possible N-Body hillbert space and then uses Exact diognlization texhinique to solve the finite chain and plot the currospoinding density visually and also the energy levels. (there are better optimized waves to generate the hilbert space, I have resorted to the brute force one, simple enough system and hence not that time consuming.) 


If the jupyter does not load, please download it and then run it. 
Already excurted copy is in the PDF if you want to know what you are getting into.

PS: not added any information in the notebook, will add soon.
