- Quick monolayer LiCoO2 generation with Li at positions respecting symetries formed using the mid points of Delaunay triangulation algorithm
- Along with plot of spatial depedence of currosponding energy and Magnetic moment. ( need to be rechecked ) calculator is an external wrapper to QUESTAAL code ( will be adding it later on)
